                  <p><b>Where is the American Midwest?</b> It might seem like a simple question, but as with so many socially constructed geographic concepts, it can be surprisingly hard to answer. We know that it exists (at least as a shared cultural artifact) and we can say with decent certainty what it isn't (the coastal regions of the U.S.), but actually defining and drawing a line around the Midwest is another story. Public polling has revealed that there is significant variance in how people define the region. To take one example, in a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/society/articles/43618-drawing-midwest-map-what-states-americans-think">2022 YouGov poll</a> of U.S. adult citizens, Iowa was the state with the highest percentage of respondents indicating it is entirely within the Midwest (61%), but a full 15% of respondents said Iowa is not in the Midwest at all!</p>
                  <p>How can a region so clearly exist yet be so amorphous? The answer, I believe, comes down to what people think of when they think of the Midwest - the panoply of social concepts and cultural connotations that combine to form one's mental picture of the region. Corn, hogs, factories, the Great Lakes, the Mississippi River, the Louisiana Purchase, the Big Ten, hot dish, walleye, Lutherans, and on and on - each of these phenomena is connected to a broader construction of what the Midwest is. By visualizing the spatial distribution of some of these phenomena, I hope to help reveal the patterns that inform a complex socio-geographic concept, and to show why systematizing them into one uniform, well defined region is so hard.</p>
                  <p>This webmap has five layers, each of which use publicly available spatial data as an analogue for the distribution of a phenomenon associated with the Midwest. These layers can be turned on and off using the menu in the top right corner of the map (you may need to click twice). You can drag your cursor over the layers to see popups with additional contextual information.</p>
                  <p>We begin with the simplest conception of the Midwest. The U.S. Census Bureau defines the <a href="https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf">Midwest Region</a> as a collection of 12 states: Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Missouri. These states are highlighted with heavy outlines on the map, and they will remain visible as a reference layer as you click through the other layers.</p>

      "Watersheds": `<h3>Water</h3><p>The Midwest is strongly associated with two famous hydrological features: the Great Lakes and the "Mighty" Mississippi River. The Mississippi has a historical connotation as the boundary between the Eastern and Western portions of the United States, and its course forms part of the borders of 10 U.S. states. Its length and navigability has made it a crucial corridor of exploration, commerce, and transportation for centuries. The Great Lakes are the defining geographic feature of what is often referred to as the Upper Midwest, and have similarly been crucial to travel, trade, and culture in their surrounding region. Taken together, the Great Lakes form the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Great-Lakes">largest surface of fresh water</a> in the world, and many of the largest cities in the Midwest hug their shores (not to mention the largest city in Canada).</p><p>This layer uses the watersheds of the Mississippi (symbolized in red) and the Great Lakes (symbolized in green) to represent the spatial influence of these water bodies. All of the lakes and rivers contained within these watersheds are also depicted. A <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/watersheds-and-drainage-basins">watershed</a> is an area of land in which all water drains to one outflow point. Put another way, every drop of rain that falls on a watershed and doesn't evaporate, get absorbed into the soil, or stored will eventually flow through that watershed's outflow point. The full Mississippi River watershed, which includes the watersheds of all its tributaries (like the Missouri and Ohio Rivers), covers <a href="https://www.nps.gov/miss/riverfacts.htm">40% of the area</a> of the continental U.S. and is the <a href="https://netedu.xauat.edu.cn/jpkc/netedu/jpkc2009/szylyybh/content/wlzy/4/Watersheds%20of%20the%20World%202005.pdf">fourth largest</a> riparian watershed in the world.</p><h4>Data Sources:</h4><p><a href="https://water.usgs.gov/themes/hydrologic-units/#wbd-2024-snapshot%20Access%20National%20Hydrography%20Products%20%7C%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey">Watersheds</a></p><p><a href="https://www.cec.org/north-american-environmental-atlas/lakes-and-rivers-2023">Rivers and Lakes</a></p>`,
      "Agriculture": `<h3>Agriculture</h3>
                      <p>For many, the most prominent mental image of the Midwest is of endless rows of crops extending across a flat plain. The United States has the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/agricultural-output-dollars?country=CHN~IND~USA~BRA~IDN">third largest agricultural output</a> of any country, and much of this activity is concentrated in the wide, flat central region of the continent that was once prairies and grassland. To represent agriculture, I have chosen to symbolize all U.S. counties by acres of corn harvested for grain in 2022, with darker colors of green indicating more acres. There are a number of staple crops that could be used to depict Midwestern farming, but none more classic or prominent than corn. The United States is by far the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/global-food?tab=chart&amp;facet=none&amp;country=USA~BRA~ZAF%3BhideControls~CHN~ARG~IND&amp;Food=Maize+%28corn%29&amp;Metric=Production&amp;Per+capita=false">world's largest producer of corn</a>, and that production is concentrated in the rich, moist soils of the Mississippi River watershed. These areas provide the right combination of hot summers and precipitation for a plant that was first domesticated in the <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/659998">valleys of southwest Mexico</a>.</p>

      "Historical Territories": `<h3>History</h3>
                                <p>Before the Midwest was the middle of the United States, it was the nearest portion of the continent's vast Western expanse stretching to the Pacific Ocean (as its name implies). For the residents of the 13 original U.S. states of the Eastern seaboard, the Midwest first existed as lines on a page, maps of a frontier barely known but eagerly claimed by the fledgling nation. The Midwest was imagined by the residents of this new nation before it was settled by them, and some of its early connotations of vastness and verdant abundance persist to this day.</p>
                                <p>As a representation of the early American conception of the Midwest, this layer depicts three historical territories that compose the vast majority of the area commonly considered the Midwest. The first, known as the Northwest Territory (symbolized in light blue), was part of the unorganized territory west of the original colonies ceded to the United States by Great Britain at the end of the Revolutionary War. In 1787, it was <a href="https://guides.loc.gov/northwest-ordinance">incorporated</a> as the first organized territory of the nation. The second territory (symbolized in dark blue) is the infamous Louisiana Purchase of 1803, which pushed the nation west of the Mississippi River and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Louisiana-Purchase">doubled its area</a>. The third area (symbolized in purple) was disputed by the U.S. and Great Britain after the Louisiana Purchase and finally exchanged with Britain in 1818 for the area of the Louisiana Purchase North of the 49th parallel.</p>

      "Ethnicity": `<h3>Ethnicity/Ancestry</h3>
<p>What do lager, polka, bratwurst, frankfurters, and Lutheranism have in common? They are all cultural artifacts strongly associated with the Midwest, but also with Germany. German-American culture is steeped into the fabric of the Midwest, following waves of German emigration to the region in the 1800s. This layer depicts that influence by symbolizing U.S. continental counties by the percentage of their population claiming German ancestry in the U.S. Census Bureau 2019-2023 American Community Survey (with darker colors of orange/brown indicating higher percentages). It confirms the dominance of German heritage in the traditional Midwest, but also reveals the preponderance of German Americans in other areas like Pennsylvania, Western New York, Texas, and the Intermountain West. This makes sense - Germany is still the most common ancestral origin among all Americans - but it also helps to explain why some places outside of the traditional Midwest feel so Midwestern (like Pittsburgh and Buffalo).</p>

      "Climate": `<h3>Climate</h3>
<p>This layer depicts the climate zones of North America as defined by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification">Koppen-Geiger Climate Classification</a> system. This system divides the Earth's climate into 30 discrete zones based on their seasonal patterns of temperature and precipitation. It reveals that the central portion of the United States is dominated by two climate zones: humid continental with hot summers (Dfa) and humid continental with mild summers (Dfb). Both zones are typified by year-round precipitation, cold winters, and (as their names imply) warm to hot summers. These are the climate conditions that allow the Corn Belt to bloom each year.</p>
